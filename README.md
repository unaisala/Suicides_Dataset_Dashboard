# Suicides_Dataset_Dashboard
This is a more advanced data visualization project fully developed on my own, applying what I learnt with several YouTube tutorials about Tableau software.

The dataset that I used is available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016 

In this case, I used more advanced techniques and the final dashboard is totally interactive. With this in mind, I recommend to open it using Tableau.
